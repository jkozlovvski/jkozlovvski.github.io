Aspiring to find my place in life. [MIMUW](https://www.mimuw.edu.pl) (mathematics, mechanics and informatics departament of University of Warsaw) alumni, where I had a pleasure of studying mathematics and informatics.

I intend to write a blog about things that passionate me in my current state of mind (which tends to change a lot). I like thinking about problems, talking to people and have an inner urge to help those around me.

*[Q]* Why did I decide to use jekyll to build this website: Cause I'm a huge fan of [Karpathy's work](http://karpathy.github.io/2014/07/01/switching-to-jekyll/) and (not getting around that statement) I'm this little boy that mimics what the older boys do. So yeah, there's that.

Currently I'm enrolled as MD student at medical university of Lodz.

Don't hesitate to hit me up with any *questions* ٩(^ᗜ^ )و ´-
