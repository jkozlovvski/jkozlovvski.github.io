Aspiring to find my place in life. MIMUW (mathematics, mechanics and informatics departament of University of Warsaw) alumni, where I had a pleasure of studying mathematics and informatics.

I intend to write a blog about things that passionate me in my current state of mind (which tends to change a lot). I like thinking about problems, talking to people and have an inner urge to help those around me.

Don't hesitate to hit me up ٩(^ᗜ^ )و ´-
